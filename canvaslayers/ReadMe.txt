CanvasLayers
-----------------

  CanvasLayers is a small javascript library for adding layers to the HTML5
  canvas tag.  Unlike other canvas layer libraries, which use a stack of
  several canvas tags, only one canvas is used.
  
  See http://www.bitbucket.org/ant512/canvaslayers for more information.
  
Requirements
------------

  Any modern web browser (anything Webkit or Gecko-based, Opera, etc).  It even
  works in IE9, but is very slow in that browser.
